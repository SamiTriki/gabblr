### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

Gabblr uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Satellizer] - simple to use, end-to-end, token-based authentication module for AngularJS, by [Sahat]
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Laravel] - The PHP framework for web artisans 

/!\ the back end is located in the "api" folder and is made with laravel, however, the rest of my team will provide a C# based api, the laravel part is just for me <3

### Todo's

 - Write Install documentation

### Thanks

* [Sahat] - For his amazing Satellizer library
* [Leandra] - For letting me use her photographs, check them out, they're amazing
